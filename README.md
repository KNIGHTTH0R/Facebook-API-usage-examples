# Facebook-API-usage-examples
This repository contains a very basic Python script that shows how to query Facebook's Graph API, and more specifically:

- How to search via the API (e.g. pages),
- How to collect information via the API (e.g. pages' fans number)
- How to collect objects (e.g. pages' posts)
